# 🛒 E-commerce Backend API

This repository houses the backend implementation of a scalable and modular **E-commerce Platform** built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. Designed with **RESTful** principles, this API can easily be integrated with frontend technologies such as React, Angular, or even mobile applications.

The backend is divided into well-structured modules to ensure **scalability** and **maintainability**, supporting the essential functionalities of a typical online shopping experience—user management, product listings, order processing, coupon-based discounts, and customer reviews.

Built with **production-readiness** in mind, this project also incorporates:

* Secure JWT-based authentication
* Robust error handling
* File upload support for product images
* A configurable environment setup to easily deploy on any platform.
